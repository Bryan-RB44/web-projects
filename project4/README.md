## Project #4 - Bluesky Bot
Due 11/17  
Create an account on BlueSky and make a bot that runs automatically! What is the interval it posts at? Try bigger times, like once a day or once a week. Think about using an external api to produce content.   

### Deliverables
Due 11/17 
* In the discussion post, you will link:
    1) A link to the bot on bluesky
    2) A link to your code (on github)
    3) Documentation (see documentation notes)

### Examples and Inspiration
* Allison Parrish, [everyword](https://twitter.com/everyword?lang=en)
* Darius Kazemi, [bot summit](http://tinysubversions.com/2013/11/bot-summit/) -- sadly a lot of these bots are removed from twitter aka x (which is also why we are using Mastodon)
* Colin Mitchell, [botsin.space](https://botsin.space/public/local) -- a mastodon server specifically for bots
