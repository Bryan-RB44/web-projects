## Project #5 - Final
Due 12/15
For your final project, you will design and build a website starting from *one* of the following four prompts:

- a website that evolves over time;
- a website that is different for every one of its visitors;
- a website that is a gift to someone you care about;

These are broad prompts meant to get you started, and can be interpreted as literally or abstractly as you see fit. As usual, you are encouraged to bring your own design and artistic interests into this project. Regardless of which prompt you end up choosing, your website should take advantage of the fact that it lives in a networked environment, and should use the web browserâ€™s affordances in meaningful ways to convey your concept.

### Deliverables
Due 12/1  
Choose your starting prompt, and come up with a concept and design for your website. Do your research as well, for both concept and visual style: other websites, pieces of art, zines, posters, books, installations, etc. You should design each page your website will have, in order to fully focus on the implementation over the following weeks.

Due 12/15  
The project is due, as a website hosted on your Hunter server.
* In the discussion post, you will link:
    1) A link to the website (eg. `https://film1.hunter.cuny.edu/NET-ID/project5/`)
    2) A link to your code (on github)
    3) Documentation (see documentation notes)
