        <!-- Write about how unbelievable things exist in space to begin with -->
        <p>First off, I'd like to ask you: What's something we're all used to knowing about space but odd once you think about them some more?</p>

        <p>Would it be the <em>chaotic</em> mess of dust and stars out there and everywhere?</p>
        <img src="images/nebulaStars.jpg">

        <p>Would it be <b>size</b> of the planets that aren't too far from us?</p>

        <p>Or even the fact we have a <b>giant rock</b> rock in our night sky which is considered normal for us?</p>

        <p>For me, it would be something much smaller than that.</p>
