        <p>It could've been space debris, our own creations sinking back to Earth. It could've also been ancient rock that went to our planet by pure chance.<br>Either way, it was something special to witness and something I haven't witnessed again even 2 years later.</p>

        <p>Is there <i>anything</i> to take away from this story?</p>
        <p>To enjoy the moment?<br>To enjoy even what seems like the little things><br>To always have a camera be prepared for anything?</p>

        <p>Truth is there is no moral, not everything needs one! But at least someone else has heard my story!</p>

        <p>Now if you don't mind me, I'm heading back to the roof.</p>
