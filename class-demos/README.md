It is expected for you to follow along with class demos. Please add them to this folder as you go along so I can see your progress!

Each class will have an accompanying week folder, and your file structure should mimic that. You should have a folder titled `week_x` or `class_x` for every class. 

You can view the complete class demos in the class repository: https://github.com/samheckle/web-projects-fa-25/tree/main/classes
